    A prime number is a number greater than 1 that is not evenly divisible by any number greater than one and smaller than itself. For example, 13 is a prime number because it is not evenly divisible by any number from 2 to 12.
    Implement the function nextPrime that takes as input an integer num and returns the smallest prime number greater than num.
    Example 1: nextPrime(10) = 11. 11 is the smallest prime number greater than 10
    Example 2: nextPrime(8) = 11. 11 is the smallest prime number greater than 8
