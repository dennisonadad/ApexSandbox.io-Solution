    Some plants are considered companion plants. They grow better when planted next to each other. For the purpose of this problem, we consider the following plants to be companions: lettuce and cucumbers, lettuce and onions, onions and carrots, and onions and tomatoes.
    Write a function isCompanion that takes as input two strings plant1 and plant2. If the two plants are companion plants based on the criteria described above, return true. Otherwise, return false.
    Example 1: companionPlants('onions', 'lettuce') = true
    Example 2: companionPlants('lettuce', 'tomatoes') = false
